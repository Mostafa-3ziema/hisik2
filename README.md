### Scan it to know

>Graduation Project

**Hisik** is a Object detection 2D application intended to scan any product you like to find out its brand, price, colors and Places where sold.

## Techniques


this project is built on using a Cross Platform **IONIC** for the Front-End, and for Back-End we use a Python Django REST-API **DRF**,
and **Google Cloud Vision Api** for the object Detection, and **Firebase** to image storage.
